	   <p> Dialogue and Universalism is the peer reviewed 
	   academic journal of the International Society for 
	   Universal Dialogue (ISUD). ​ It is sponsored 
	   by the International Society for Universal Dialogue  and
	   by the Philosophy for Dialogue Foundation. It is published
	   by the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish 
	   Academy of   Sciences and by the Philosophy for Dialogue 
	   Foundation. Since 2019 Dialogue and Universalism is 
	   published three times a year. ​ Dialogue and Universalism, 
	   published in English, is wholly open for every scholars 
	   in the world, not being a publishing forum for the ISUD 
	   members only. All contributors are equally kindly welcome. 
	   AIMS AND SCOPE ​ Dialogue and Universalism publishes 
	   philosophical articles from all philosophical traditions 
	   and domains. The metaphilosophical diversity is admitted 
	   as it is believed that dialogue, discussions, also clashing
	   between philosophical traditions, schools and attitudes  as
	   well as drawing in philosophizing from other kinds of human
	   knowledge lead to a synergy effect which develops and 
	   enhances philosophy as a whole. Dialogue and Universalism
	   tends to show that philosophy is an essential eternal domain 
	   of human culture and an inevitable element of the nowadays
	   human world.  Dialogue and Universalism aims to demonstrate 
	   that philosophy plays a participative role: its conceptions, 
	   diagnoses and ideals impact or/and should impact the human
	   world. ​ The ISUD community is convinced that philosophy has
	   an important role to play in the struggle for the future of
	   humanity. Critical and creative rational thinking is an 
	   opportunity for humankind to resist the lies and illusions 
	   of ideological manipulations that serve as instruments of 
	   enslavement and oppression. This open and broad vision of 
	   philosophy as an expression of human rationality offers a 
	   chance to free people’s awareness, to open their minds, and 
	   to extend their possibilities of thinking and acting. 
	   In doing so, philosophical reflection is able to refine 
	   and renew old ideals and values as well as to create new 
	   ones. It is these two aspects — free consciousness and new 
	   ideals — that are necessary to build a more decent human 
	   world.  Philosophy with its amazingly sophisticated ways
	   of thinking disposes a tremendous power to cope with the 
	   world and to change it. Philosophy is free from technical
	   and practical interests, and constituted by the pursuit of
	   removing — from a highly distanced and neutral 
	   perspective — falsehood, prejudices, mental, cultural,
	   religious and social slavery. So  it  gives a hope for 
	   human beings’ emancipation as well as for an alteration of the world, 
	   first spiritual, and then material. ​
