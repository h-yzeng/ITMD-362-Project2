# ITMD-362 Project 2: Website Redesign

This is our submission repository for project 2 in the ITMD-362 Human-Computer Interaction and Web Design Course.

The goal of this project is to redesign one of the worst-designed websites. In this case, we selected https://www.worldialogue.org/ as the website to redesign as the original website was made using Wix years ago without any proper design and program structuring.

This project is made in self-selected teams of 3 students who will redesign a website in class. Our redesign employs sound principles of human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.
All of the code is programmed from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS without any code-generators like WYSIWYGs, Bootstrap, or other off-the-shelf frameworks.

We utilized three media queries for mobile sizing and tablet sizing adjustments to ensure a touch-friendly experience for mobile users.

Project Goals:
- Conduct a task analysis for creating a user-centered design
- Select 3 pages of the website to redo. Two content pages and one process page. The process page should be a html form page. Like a signup page or a purchase page. One content page should be the home page.
- Apply design principles including color/material, typography, accessible media, and grid-based design.
- Execute a progressively enhanced, touch-friendly, mobile-first responsive design focused on system users and tasks.
- Write informative text content; catch error conditions and guide users accordingly.
- Experiment with design and interaction patterns for a pleasing user experience.
- Engage in agile, iterative web design and development within a team-based workflow on GitHub, via pull requests and code reviews.
