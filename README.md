This is my personal submission repository for Project 2 in the ITMD-362 Course at Illinois Tech: Human-Computer Interaction and Web Design.

The goal of this project is to redesign one of the worst-designed websites. In this case, we selected https://www.worldialogue.org/ as the website to redesign as the original website was made using Wix years ago without proper design and program structuring.

This project is done in self-selected teams of 3 students who will redesign a website in class. Our redesign employs sound principles of human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.
All of the code is programmed from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS without any code generators like WYSIWYGs, Bootstrap, or other off-the-shelf frameworks.

We utilized various media queries for mobile sizing and tablet sizing adjustments to ensure a touch-friendly experience for mobile users.

Project Goals:
- Conduct a task analysis for creating a user-centered design
- Select 3 pages of the website to redo. Two content pages and one process page. The process page should be an HTML form page like a signup page or a purchase page. One content page should be the home page.
- Apply design principles including color/material, typography, accessible media, and grid-based design.
- Execute a progressively enhanced, touch-friendly, mobile-first responsive design focused on system users and tasks.
- Write informative text content; catch error conditions and guide users accordingly.
- Experiment with design and interaction patterns for a pleasing user experience.
- Engage in agile, iterative web design and development within a team-based workflow on GitHub, via pull requests and code reviews.
